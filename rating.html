        <p>This first standard rating systems only started to emerge in the 20th century. A chess rating is a tool that makes it easy to measure a player's probable performance against another opponent. It is expressed by a number that can go from 100 to (theoretically) infinity. </p>
        <p> While there are many different rating systems, the most popular one is the ELO system, used my FIDE (World Chess Federation).</p>
