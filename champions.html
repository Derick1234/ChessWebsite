            <img id = "a" src="https://en.chessbase.com/thumb/79694_l200">
            <p>William Steinitz (born Wilhelm Steinitz, May 14, 1836 – August 12, 1900) was an Austrian and later American chess master, and the first official World Chess Champion, from 1886 to 1894. He was also a highly influential writer and chess theoretician. Statistical rating systems give Steinitz a rather low ranking among world champions, mainly because he took several long breaks from competitive play. However, an analysis based on one of these rating systems shows that he was one of the most dominant players in the history of the game. Steinitz was unbeaten in match play for 32 years, from 1862 to 1894. </p>
